Lesson one Урок номер один

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.000
How? How?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500
lesson one

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.000
lesson - значит урок, one - один, lesson one - урок номер один

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
lesson one

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Okay, but you don't make very English sounds.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I can feel it myself. That's how you pronounced the first word, that's how you said hello

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.500
Hi - Привет
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.000
Yes, that's Hi. I knew right away that you were a foreigner

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.490
No, I'll never be able to do that.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.890
Listen to Hi, the sound is not the same as in the Russian word bread. You pronounce it gently with a gasp,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.990
 as if you were running, running, out of breath and exhaled Hi.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.200
Try Hi. Нi again Hi. Oh well, you did it. Hi.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.100
Now you can say hello to me. Hi brother rabbit.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.280
Or you can say hello like this: Hello - здравствуйте. Hello.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.690
You forgot that the "H" sound is pronounced gently with a gasp.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.300
Hello, hello. Yes, yes. Hello, hello.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.800
Now in the morning you can still say hello like this: Good morning,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.740
good which means хорошее, доброе, morning - утро.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.280
Good morning - Доброе утро. Well, I will never be able to do this again. Let's go together.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.280
Feel with your tongue the tubercles behind the upper front teeth and touch them with the very tip of your tongue.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.090
Oh, I really never noticed the tubercles.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.790
But now put the tip of your tongue on these tubercles and forcefully pronounce

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.280
d- d- d- It's like large drops are dripping onto a sheet of iron.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:35.600
D- d- d-. D- d- d-. Well done And now good, good. Good, good.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.790
No, it won't work that way.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.490
Your drops are not on iron, but on leaves. Look at my lower jaw.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.990
Do you see how big you think it is, by any chance?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.690
It’s normal to strain it all the time, including sounds at the end of words.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.190
We don’t listen to good, good. Good good, even due to unaccustomed habits I got sick.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.890
And now listen -ning -ning, as if a bell is ringing -ning -ning.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.190
You can even feel it tickling, you can put both shoulder blades on the sides of your nose and pronounce it.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.990
Oh,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.990
it’s true, it’s as if something is rattling in the nose,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.990
And now my

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.390
Udmurts

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.790
Good morning,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.090
good morning good morning good.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.390
Oh, what does evening mean,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.090
Wonderful Good evening, definitely Good evening.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.890
Good evening. So we can say hello tonight.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.790
Now let's repeat it again.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.990
How can you say hello in English, just don’t forget about the sounds.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.690
Oh, I already forgot everything. It always seems that way, Let's try it.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.490
Hello Hello Hello Good morning.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.390
Good evening.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.390
Forgot Guryev Well done

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.190
And that at the end of all English words there are such ringing sounds gudmonin,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.590
Beautiful of course, very tired.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.490
It's not that big for me. Of course not.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.290
Listen to DDT on the tip of your tongue.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.990
There, on the tubercles, the sound is pronounced dullly,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.290
as if the drops were not on iron,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.790
it was definitely dripping leaves.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.790
And now I know why you

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.690
pronounce Russian words so funny, accurately, So, out of habit, you put your tongue on the tubercles,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.990
just like for an English word, Tanya really didn’t notice.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.190
Well, let's practice OKATO OKATO

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.590
ocat.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.890
What does this mean cat?

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.190
Let's go again ok, ok ok,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.490
ok, ok, Bad lunch,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.690
lunch lunch bat.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.690
Maybe I won’t repeat this. Why is it easy lunch lunch.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.990
I'm afraid, they say, they are catching nonsense in their ears. What kind of prejudice is this? And harmful?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.090
Okay, here we go. Out of fear, you even forgot about your language.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.590
Oh, it's really lunch.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:09.690
Now listen to how important it is in English not to deafen the voiced consonants at the end of a word.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.290
If I say it, it will mean a bat.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.890
If Bad is bad, you feel the difference, I don’t see the limit,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.890
my grandfather would have been good, no matter what they were called,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.390
I’m a little tired.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.690
Well, then that's enough for the first time.
